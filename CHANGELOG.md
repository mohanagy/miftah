# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- [#18](https://github.com/mohanagy/miftah/issues/18) The packed-package contract now exercises the installed CLI through shell and Windows command quoting, paths with spaces, generated help, stable category exits, JSON automation output, and normalized/redacted audit-log output.
- [#18](https://github.com/mohanagy/miftah/issues/18) The CLI reference now documents generated help, every command and option, version compatibility output, exit statuses, JSON streams, and audit snapshot/follow safety boundaries.

### Changed

- [#16](https://github.com/mohanagy/miftah/issues/16) The library root export is now an intentional, documented public API. Internal server, process, profile, routing, policy, audit, and secret-management classes are no longer available from `@lubab/miftah`; use the configuration utilities and `createMiftahRuntime()` instead. This pre-1.0 breaking change requires a minor release.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Package metadata and a verified npm pack-content contract.
- Least-privilege CI and OIDC trusted-publishing workflows.
- Dependency update, contribution, vulnerability-reporting, and repository templates.

### Fixed

- [#1](https://github.com/mohanagy/miftah/issues/1) Policy lookup now fails closed and configuration rejects unknown profile policy references instead of allowing a policy fail-open.
- [#2](https://github.com/mohanagy/miftah/issues/2) Secret redaction preserves ordinary identifiers while still removing configured credentials from logs, errors, and discovery results.
- [#3](https://github.com/mohanagy/miftah/issues/3) The GitHub Docker preset injects profile credentials correctly and pins the upstream image tag.
- [#4](https://github.com/mohanagy/miftah/issues/4) Configuration now rejects unsupported lifecycle controls, state/UI settings, routing plugins and non-hybrid modes, profile metadata and matchers, per-profile upstream `transport`/`command`/`url` overrides, and configurable tool namespaces with `UNSUPPORTED_CONFIG_OPTION` instead of silently ignoring them. Secret and audit redaction remain force-on protections.
- [#5](https://github.com/mohanagy/miftah/issues/5) Resource and prompt proxying no longer silently selects the first configured upstream: zero- and multi-upstream bundles fail closed, and one-entry bundles select their upstream explicitly.

## Release policy

Miftah is experimental and pre-1.0, so incompatible changes may occur between minor versions and must be called out here. For each release, maintainers move **Unreleased** entries into a dated version section, update `package.json` and `package-lock.json` together using npm tooling, and publish a GitHub release tagged `v<package-version>`. The release workflow publishes only after the tag, ancestry, tests, build, CLI smoke test, and package contents are verified.
